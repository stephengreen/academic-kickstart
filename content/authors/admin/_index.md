I am a postdoctoral researcher in gravitational waves at the Albert Einstein Institute in Potsdam. My current research interests are in [black hole perturbation theory](project/teukolsky) and [deep-learning methods for data analysis](project/inference).

I grew up in Toronto, Canada, where I attended the University of Toronto. I obtained my PhD in physics at the University of Chicago under [Robert Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wald), where I studied effects of general relativity in cosmology and [debunked the idea that small scale structure could drive cosmological acceleration and mimic dark energy](project/backreaction). I then moved to the University of Guelph and Perimeter Institute, where I studied [turbulence in gravitational waves](project/ads-stability) and black hole [superradiant instabilities](project/superradiance). Now I am a member of LIGO, and my work focuses on gravitational waves.
