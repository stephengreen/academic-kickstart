abstract: 'We develop a formalism to treat higher order (nonlinear) metric
  perturbations of the Kerr spacetime in a Teukolsky framework. We
  first show that solutions to the linearized Einstein equation with
  nonvanishing stress tensor can be decomposed into a pure gauge part
  plus a zero mode (infinitesimal perturbation of the mass and spin)
  plus a perturbation arising from a certain scalar ("Debye-Hertz")
  potential, plus a so-called "corrector tensor." The scalar
  potential is a solution to the spin $-2$ Teukolsky equation with a
  source. This source, as well as the tetrad components of the
  corrector tensor, are obtained by solving certain decoupled ordinary
  differential equations involving the stress tensor. As we show,
  solving these ordinary differential equations reduces simply to
  integrations in the coordinate $r$ in outgoing Kerr-Newman
  coordinates, so in this sense, the problem is reduced to the
  Teukolsky equation with source, which can be treated by a separation
  of variables ansatz.  Since higher order perturbations are subject
  to a linearized Einstein equation with a stress tensor obtained from
  the lower order perturbations, our method also applies iteratively
  to the higher order metric perturbations, and could thus be used to
  analyze the nonlinear coupling of perturbations in the near-extremal
  Kerr spacetime, where weakly turbulent behavior has been conjectured
  to occur. Our method could also be applied to the study of
  perturbations generated by a pointlike body traveling on a timelike
  geodesic in Kerr, which is relevant to the extreme mass ratio
  inspiral problem.'
