abstract: "We provide a simple discussion of our results on the backreaction effects of density inhomogeneities in cosmology without mentioning one-parameter families or weak limits. Emphasis is placed on the manner in which 'averaging' is done and the fact that one is solving Einsteinâ€™s equation. The key assumptions and results that we rigorously derived within our original math- ematical framework are thereby explained in a heuristic way."
