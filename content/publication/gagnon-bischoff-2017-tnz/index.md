abstract: 'Observations of gravitational waves from inspiralling neutron star
  binaries---such as GW170817---can be used to constrain the nuclear
  equation of state by placing bounds on stellar tidal
  deformability. For slowly rotating neutron stars, the response to a
  weak quadrupolar tidal field is characterized by four
  internal-structure-dependent constants called "Love
  numbers". The *tidal* Love numbers $k_2^\text{el}$ and
  $k_2^\text{mag}$ measure the tides raised by the gravitoelectric and
  gravitomagnetic components of the applied field, and the
  \emph{rotational-tidal} Love numbers $\mathfrak{f}^\text{o}$ and
  $\mathfrak{k}^\text{o}$ measure those raised by couplings between
  the applied field and the neutron star spin. In this work we compute
  these four Love numbers for perfect fluid neutron stars with
  realistic equations of state. We discover (nearly) equation-of-state
  *independent* relations between the rotational-tidal Love
  numbers and the moment of inertia, thereby extending the scope of
  $I$-Love-$Q$ universality. We find that similar relations hold among the
  tidal and rotational-tidal Love numbers. These relations extend the
  applications of $I$-Love universality in gravitational-wave
  astronomy. As our findings differ from those reported in the
  literature, we derive general formulas for the rotational-tidal Love
  numbers in post-Newtonian theory and confirm numerically that they
  agree with our general-relativistic computations in the weak-field
  limit.'
